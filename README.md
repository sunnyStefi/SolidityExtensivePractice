# Extensive Solidity Practice contracts

### Summary
This project provides an in-depth exploration of Solidity features and nuances. It tests a wide range of cases and combinations to make a comprehensive collection of how most of Solidity elements function.

Each feature contract that's loocated in the `src` directory is paired with an exhaustive test contract.

The results of these tests will be documented and maintained in a GitBook (link coming soon).
